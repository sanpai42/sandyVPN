# SandyVPN

**OpenVPN 3 Manager for Linux**

Tired of typing `openvpn3 session-start`, entering your username, waiting, then doing it all again every hour when working form home? 


SandyVPN is a small Linux desktop app that turns your VPN into one-click — with a live connection dashboard, encrypted saved credentials, and a funny ginger cat to remind you to stop scrolling reels!

## Why SandyVPN?

**One Single Click!**  
Save your profile once. Hit Connect every day you login. SandyVPN handles the rest.

**See your session at a glance.**  
A live timer, real-time stats, and one-click Disconnect or Reconnect — no tabbing back to slack to copy your password!

**Secure**  
Passwords are securely encrypted on disk and NOT stored in the RAM during runtime. Your credentials aren't sitting in plain text waiting for the russian hacker.

**Kawai**  
Dark UI, orange accents, a soft green glow when you’re connected, and a mascot that dozes off when the VPN’s down. 

## What you get

- One-click connect to any imported OpenVPN 3 profile
- Encrypted credential storage (save once, connect many times)
- Live **Connected for** timer and session statistics
- Disconnect & reconnect without reopening a terminal, especially useful when working from home!
- Sleeping / awake cat mascot with a new pun every launch 🐈

## Requirements

- Linux with [OpenVPN 3](https://openvpn.net/community-docs/openvpn-client-for-linux.html) installed (`openvpn3` on your `PATH`)
- Python 3.10+ (auto installed if missing)

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-tk python3-venv
```

# Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanpai42/sandyOVPN
cd sandyvpn

bash ./install.sh
```

That sets up a virtual environment, installs dependencies, and adds **SandyVPN** to your application menu and Desktop. IF you have openvpn, it gets upgraded to openvpn3 with your consent.

## Run

Open **SandyOVPN** from your app launcher / menu!


---

**Quick start:** enter your config name, username, and password → **Save credentials** (first time) → **Connect**. Next time, just click Connect and go.

Built for personal use on a trusted Linux machine. Credentials are encrypted at rest; decrypt happens only when you connect.

KNOWN Bugs:

If your ovpn file is in a secure folder that needs admin access, you might not be able to drag and drop the file. Try moving it into the project folder or launching app as sudo.


*So long, and thanks for all the fish! 🐬*
